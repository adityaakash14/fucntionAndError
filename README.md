# myContract Solidity Contract

This Solidity contract named `myContract` showcases three different functions, each demonstrating a specific aspect of error handling in smart contracts using `require`, `assert`, and `revert`. Below is a README to explain the purpose of this contract, how to use it, and other relevant information.

## Description

The `myContract` Solidity contract illustrates different ways to handle errors and exceptions in Ethereum smart contracts. It contains three functions:

1. `setValue(uint256 _newValue)`: This function sets the contract's public variable `value` to a new value, but it uses `require()` to validate that the new value is greater than 0. If the condition is not met, it throws an error with a custom error message.

2. `assertExample(uint256 _a, uint256 _b)`: This function takes two unsigned integers `_a` and `_b` and returns their sum. However, it uses `assert()` to check if `_a` is not equal to `_b`. If the condition is false, it throws an error.

3. `revertExample()`: This function intentionally triggers a revert with a custom error message using the `revert()` function. It is a demonstration of how to forcefully revert a transaction.

## Getting Started

To use this contract, you can follow these steps:

1. **Environment Setup**: Ensure you have access to a Solidity development environment like Remix or Truffle.

2. **Create a Solidity File**: Create a new Solidity file (e.g., `myContract.sol`) and paste the contract code into it.

3. **Compile the Contract**: Use the Solidity compiler to compile the contract. Make sure the compiler version is compatible with the contract code.

4. **Deploy the Contract**: Deploy the compiled contract to the Ethereum blockchain using a development environment or a testnet. You will need some ether for gas fees during deployment.

5. **Interact with the Contract**: After deployment, you can interact with the contract by calling its functions through a user interface or using Ethereum wallets.

## Functions

### `setValue(uint256 _newValue)`

- Input: An unsigned integer `_newValue` representing the new value to set.
- Behavior: This function sets the contract's `value` to the provided `_newValue` only if `_newValue` is greater than 0. If `_newValue` is not greater than 0, it throws an error with the custom message "Value must be greater than 0."

### `assertExample(uint256 _a, uint256 _b)`

- Inputs: Two unsigned integers, `_a` and `_b`.
- Behavior: This function returns the sum of `_a` and `_b` only if `_a` is not equal to `_b`. If `_a` is equal to `_b`, it throws an error.

### `revertExample()`

- Behavior: This function intentionally triggers a revert with the custom message "This function always reverts." It demonstrates how to forcefully revert a transaction with a specific error message.
